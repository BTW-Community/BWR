v0.20
	- There is now a low-efficiency way to recover raw gold
	  from tools and equipment.

	- There is now a low-efficiency way to fabricate redstone
	  dust without hibachis.

	- Significant villager trading nerfs.  Villagers now only
	  sell some finished tools and buy items for emeralds.
	  Emerald can now be treated as a distinct resource with its
	  own purpose, rather than an medium for shortcuts around
	  existing gameplay.

	- Dung can be stewed into blocks similar to string to wool.

	- Fixed Soul Press fire creation.

	- Made animal cross-breeding habitats easier to construct.

	- Added low-efficency recipes for extracting raw gold from
	  tools collected from ZP's, and for obtaining hellfire
	  from ground netherrack.


v0.19
	- Added cross-breeding of animals.  Chances of rarer animals
	  are influenced by (and require) a suitable environment.

	- It is now theoretically possible to access most of the tech
	  tree in a Classic Superflat Challenge map, whereas without
	  the ability to tan leather, players were stuck on Tier 2
	  without being able to make sawmills.

	- Nerf plant cross-breeding rates.

	- Some new sound effects.


v0.18
	- Plant cross-breeding is now more of a science than
	  just blind luck.  The species of plants/fungi you
	  breed will depend on the donor species surrounding
	  them.

	- Plants that differ by metadata but not block ID,
	  such as saplings, are now correctly recognized by
	  the cross-breeding system as different species.


v0.17
	- Most plants/fungi now obtainable, given dirt,
	  bonemeal, and a hoe.  Plants and fungi exposed to
	  other species will spread mutant strains into nearby
	  fertile spaces.

	- Dead shrubs are now renewable: boil the leaves off
	  an oak sapling.


v0.16
	- Lava source blocks are now renewable.  Lava will
	  melt nearby blocks of hellfire.

	- Lilypads can now grow on the highest level of flowing
	  water, as well as source blocks, so lilypad farming
	  will work with HCB even when water is extremely scarce.

	- Lilypad growth rate is now dependent on actual immediate
	  light level, even though they will remain in place as
	  long as they have a view of the sky.

	- Restored old pre-v0.12 heat logic for dirt/clay
	  farms, to be consistent with BTW pattern of using
	  a 3x3 fire source for max efficiency.

	- Improvements to clay/dirt farming SFX.

	- Slightly nerfed clay/dirt farming speed.


v0.15
	- Press for making soul sand must now be built out of
	  sufficiently hard materials.

	- Added risk to soul sand fabrication: the process is
	  now highly exothermic.


v0.14
	- Soul sand is now renewable.  Fresh souls extracted
	  from the living must be forced into sand at high
	  mechanical pressure.

	- Replaced mossy stone with cobblestone in netherrack
	  recipe, as moss stone is too expensive compared to
	  netherrack.


v0.13
	- First publicly-available version of BWR, distributed
	  in source form, with MCP, BTW, and Minecraft as
	  external dependencies.  Requires perl, python (for mcp),
	  and a unix-like programming environment with a bsd-
	  or gnu-like make.

	- Make diamond recycling recipe lossless, as it already
	  consumes a lot of other resources, and diamonds are not
	  very useful for tool applications, being inferior to
	  steel in many ways.

	- Made Neterrack renewable.  Stew mossy cobblestone with
	  nether wart, and infuse one soul of the damned.


v0.12
	- Added risk to lapis recovery recipe: lapis is now just
	  destroyed if you forget to add a bonding agent.

	- Reduced amount of heat needed in clay/dirt farms for max
	  speed, to reduce the number of block checks needed and
	  avoid performance issues with very large farms


v0.11
	- Added some audible effects to clay/dirt farms.


v0.10
	- First private test release.

	- Dirt is now renewable.  There is a block in BTW that is
	  dirt-like and nutrient-rich, but unsuitable for planting
	  due to a low pH; rinse the acid out to leave dirt behind.
	  Added heat speeds up the process.

	- Clay is now renewable.  Sand rinsed in acid is etched
	  into finer clay particles.  Heat speeds up the process.

	- Diamonds are renewable.  Diamond equipment is tradable
	  from villagers; dissolve them in a strong alkaline to
	  destroy bonding agents and leave raw diamonds behind.

	- Lapis is now renewable.  It can be washed from the
	  products of the genetic mutants that create it.  A fine
	  mineral powder will bond to the lapis and make it settle
	  out of suspension.

	- Lilypads are now renewable.  They spread to adjacent
	  blocks, though their growth is limited, to avoid them
	  taking over existing worlds.
