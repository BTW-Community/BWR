v0.15
	- Press for making soul sand must now be built out of
	  sufficiently hard materials.

	- Added risk to soul sand fabrication: the process is
	  now highly exothermic.


v0.14
	- Soul sand is now renewable.  Infuse sand with souls.
	  However, instead of souls of the damned, only fresh
	  souls, untouched by human hands, can be used.  They
	  must be forced into the sand under pressure.

	- Replaced mossy stone with cobblestone in netherrack
	  recipe, as moss stone is too expensive compared to
	  netherrack.


v0.13
	- First publicly-available version of BWR, distributed
	  in source form, with MCP, BTW, and Minecraft as
	  external dependencies.  Requires perl, python (for mcp),
	  and a unix-like programming environment with a bsd-
	  or gnu-like make.

	- Make diamond recycling recipe lossless, as it already
	  consumes a lot of other resources, and diamonds are not
	  very useful for tool applications, being inferior to
	  steel in many ways.

	- Made Neterrack renewable.  Stew mossy cobblestone with
	  nether wart, and infuse one soul of the damned.


v0.12
	- Added risk to lapis recovery recipe: lapis is now just
	  destroyed if you forget to add a bonding agent.

	- Reduced amount of heat needed in clay/dirt farms for max
	  speed, to reduce the number of block checks needed and
	  avoid performance issues with very large farms


v0.11
	- Added some audible effects to clay/dirt farms.


v0.10
	- First private test release.

	- Dirt is now renewable.  There is a block in BTW that is
	  dirt-like and nutrient-rich, but unsuitable for planting
	  due to a low pH; rinse the acid out to leave dirt behind.
	  Added heat speeds up the process.

	- Clay is now renewable.  Sand rinsed in acid is etched
	  into finer clay particles.  Heat speeds up the process.

	- Diamonds are renewable.  Diamond equipment is tradable
	  from villagers; dissolve them in a strong alkaline to
	  destroy bonding agents and leave raw diamonds behind.

	- Lapis is now renewable.  It can be washed from the
	  products of the genetic mutants that create it.  A fine
	  mineral powder will bond to the lapis and make it settle
	  out of suspension.

	- Lilypads are now renewable.  They spread to adjacent
	  blocks, though their growth is limited, to avoid them
	  taking over existing worlds.
