========================================================================
Environment Setup on OpenBSD
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Better With Renewables build process has been tested on OpenBSD
release 5.0+.  To install the additional prerequisite packages:

	sudo pkg_add -i python zip unzip jdk

Perl and make are part of the base system and do not need to be
installed separately.



========================================================================
Environment Setup on Debian-Based Linux Distributions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Better With Renewables build process has been tested on Debian 6,
and is believed to work on similar Debian-based distributions such as
Ubuntu.  To install the additional prerequisite packages:

	sudo apt-get install perl-base zip unzip make python default-jdk



========================================================================
Environment Setup on Windows
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Java Development Kit:
	- Obtain the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) from:
	  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
	- Run the self-installer to install JDK on your system.
	  Default options are OK.

2. Install MinGW:
	- Obtain a copy of the MinGW installer from:
	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
	- Run the self-installer.
	- Make sure that the MSYS option is checked.
	- Make sure that the MinGW Development Kit option is checked.
	- The default installation location is OK.
	- Complete the installation.

3. Install Python from MCP into MSYS:
	- Obtain correct version of MCP from the MCP wiki, at either:
	    http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases#Releases
	    http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Old_Releases#History
	- Unpack the MCP archive into a temporary folder.
	- Open the MCP folder, then navigate to the runtime -> bin
	  -> python folder.
	- Copy all of these files into the bin folder inside the
	  MSYS distribution inside MinGW (default location is
	  C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\bin).
	- Rename the python_mcp.exe file you just copied to python.exe.

4. Install Final MSYS Utilities:
	- Open the MSYS Prompt (default C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\msys.bat).
	- Install the prerequisite zip/unzip utilities with the command:
	  mingw-get install msys-zip msys-unzip
	

========================================================================
Environment Setup on OS X
   (Verified on 10.8.2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Java from Apple:
   follow the instructions here http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572
   Note this is for Java SE 6,  Java SE 7 may be usable, but the install
      doesn't always setup the path properly when installed.
      
2. Install Xcode 4:
   Open the App Store and search for Xcode
   Install as you would any App from the store (it's free).
   
3. Install the command line tools:
   Start XCode go to Preferences -> Downloads -> Components
   Select Command Line Tools and click install
   You can do the next step while this is downloading,
      just keep the window open so you can make sure it installed.

4. Download Better With Renewables
   Go to File -> Source Control -> Repositories
   Click on the + -> Checkout or Clone Repository...
   Enter git://gitorious.org/bwr/bwr.git
   Choose your save location..
      This is not where you will run your minecraft server from,
      just where you will build your server.jar
   Once that is done I recommend using the release branch for stability.
      Jump to the next step if you want to stick with the master branch.
      Note: as of writing this the release branch was still at
         BTW version 4.56
   Expand the bwr Repository, select remotes
   Expand origin, select release
   Click Track Branch, check 'Automatically switch to this branch' and
      click create
   
5. Continue the standard BWR installation:
   *Make sure that the command line tools have finished downloading 
      and installing.
   You may now double click on the bwr folder in the repository to open
   the folder you checked it out to and go to Step 2 of the
   Multiplayer Server Installation section

========================================================================
Multiplayer Server Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download Better With Renewables:
	- Official site: https://gitorious.org/bwr
	- Git clone: https://git.gitorious.org/bwr/bwr.git
	- For users not using git, downloads of the latest
	  development version are at:
	    https://gitorious.org/bwr/bwr/trees/release
	- Unpack the archive into a location of your choice.
	- For Windows (MSYS) users, you will want to unpack this
	  somewhere inside your MSYS install (default
	  C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0).
	
2. Download Better Than Wolves:
	- Check the Makefile to determine the version of BTW that BWR
	  depends on.
	- Obtain correct version of BTW from forums on sargunster.com
	  http://sargunster.com/btwforum/viewforum.php?f=3
	- If a newer version is available, you can try downloading it
	  and changing the expected version in the Makefile, but results
	  are not guaranteed.
	- Place the BTWMod*.zip file in the root of the project.

3. Download Minecraft Server JAR:
	- You need the appropriate version of Minecraft on which Better
	  Than Wolves depends.
	- Latest version of Minecraft Server can be obtained from:
	    https://minecraft.net/download
	  You will need the jar, not the exe, near the bottom of the
	  page.
	- Links to download older versions are on the Minecraft wiki:
	    http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history/Development_versions
	- Place minecraft_server.jar in the root of the project.

4. Download Minecraft Coder's Pack:
	- Check the Makefile to determine the version of MCP that BWR
	  depends on; this will also correspond to the Minecraft and
	  BTW versions.
	- Obtain correct version of MCP from the MCP wiki, at either:
	    http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases#Releases
	    http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Old_Releases#History
	- If a newer version is available, you can try downloading it
	  and changing the expected version in the Makefile, but results
	  are not guaranteed.
	- Place the mcp*.zip file in the root of the project.

5. Run make:
	- Open a shell.  In Linux, you can use any terminal of your
	  choice.  In Windows, you should open the MSYS prompt
	  (default C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\msys.bat). In OS X, open Terminal.
	- Change directory (cd) to the root of the project.
	- Run "make clean && make".
	- Minecraft server will be patched with BTW, then decompiled,
	  the source code will be patched with BWR, then recompiled.

6. Install bwr_btw_minecraft_server.jar:
	- The bwr_btw_minecraft_server.jar file is the final output.
	- Install this wherever you want your multiplayer server to be
	  (or update and restart your existing server).
	- Note that this file contains code that is copyright by third
	  parties, and thus is NOT redistributable under the terms of
	  the BWR license.
	- The server JAR can be used on any operating system, regardless
	  of which operating system you used to build it, e.g. a JAR
	  built on Windows can be used on a Linux server.
