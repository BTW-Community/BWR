========================================================================
Multiplayer Server Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Prerequisites:
	- BWR requires a unix-like environment to build, tested on
	  Debian 6 and OpenBSD 5.  Other Linux/BSD operating systems
	  may work as well.
	- Python is required by MCP, tested with v2.6 and v2.7.
	- Perl is required to install the hooks, tested with v5.10
	  and v5.12.
	- Make is required (part of OS or build-essential); tested
	  with GNU and BSD make.
	- 7-zip or p7zip is required.
	- Git is recommended to obtain source and pull updates.

2. Download Better With Renewables:
	- Official site: https://gitorious.org/bwr
	- Git clone: https://git.gitorious.org/bwr/bwr.git
	- For users not using git, downloads of latest
	  development version are at:
	    https://gitorious.org/bwr/bwr/trees/release
	
3. Download Better Than Wolves:
	- Check the Makefile to determine the version of BTW that BWR
	  depends on.
	- Obtain correct version of BTW from forums on sargunster.com
	  http://sargunster.com/btwforum/viewforum.php?f=3
	- If a newer version is available, you can try downloading it
	  and changing the expected version in the Makefile, but results
	  are not guaranteed.
	- Place the BTWMod*.zip file in the root of the project.

4. Download Minecraft Server JAR:
	- You need the appropriate version of Minecraft on which Better
	  Than Wolves depends.
	- Latest version of Minecraft Server can be obtained from:
	    https://minecraft.net/download
	  You will need the jar, not the exe, near the bottom of the
	  page.
	- Links to download older versions are on the Minecraft wiki:
	    http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history/Development_versions
	- Place minecraft_server.jar in the root of the project.

5. Download Minecraft Coder's Pack:
	- Check the Makefile to determine the version of MCP that BWR
	  depends on; this will also correspond to the Minecraft and
	  BTW versions.
	- Obtain correct vesion of MCP from the MCP wiki, at either:
	    http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases#Releases
	    http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Old_Releases#History
	- If a newer version is available, you can try downloading it
	  and changing the expected version in the Makefile, but results
	  are not guaranteed.
	- Place the mcp*.zip file in the root of the project.

6. Run make clean:
	- In a shell in the root of the BWR project, run "make clean".
	- This will clean up any intermediate/output files from any
	  previous builds.

7. Run make:
	- In a shell in the root of the BWR project, run "make".
	- Minecraft server will be patched with BTW, then decompiled,
	  the source code will be patched with BWR, then recompiled.

8. Install bwr_btw_minecraft_server.jar:
	- The bwr_btw_minecraft_server.jar file is the final output.
	- Install this wherever you want your multiplayer server to be
	  (or update and restart your existing server).
	- Note that this file contains code that is copyright by third
	  parties, and thus is NOT redistributable under the terms of
	  the BWR license.
