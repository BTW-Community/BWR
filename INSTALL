Multiplayer Server Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Docker (from docker.com).  Distributions should be available
   for Windows, Linux, and Mac.

2. Create a new folder.

3. Download components and put them in the folder.  Each file should be
   placed in the folder unmodified, and named exactly as found.  You
   will need:

	- Minecraft Server (minecraft_server.jar)
	- The Mod Coder's Pack (mcp751.zip)
	- Better Than Wolves (BTWMod4-*******.zip)

4. Create a new text file named "docker.txt" in the folder, and put
   the following lines of text in it:

	FROM warr1024/btwbwr:latest
	COPY --chown=bwr:bwr . .

5. Open a docker command line (Windows) or other shell from which
   you can run docker commands (Linux/Mac) and run these commands:

	docker pull warr1024/btwbwr
	docker build --tag bwr .
	docker run -i --rm bwr >bwr.jar

6. Check for error messages.  Look for a "bwr.jar" file in the folder
   and make sure it's size is not zero.

7. Use the "bwr.jar" file as your new minecraft server jar.
