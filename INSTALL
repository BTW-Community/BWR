========================================================================
Environment Setup on OpenBSD
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Better With Renewables build process has been tested on OpenBSD
release 5.0+.  To install the additional prerequisite packages:

	sudo pkg_add -i python zip unzip

Perl and make are part of the base system and do not need to be
installed separately.



========================================================================
Environment Setup on Debian-Based Linux Distributions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Better With Renewables build process has been tested on Debian 6,
and is believed to work on similar Debian-based distributions such as
Ubuntu.  To install the additional prerequisite packages:

	sudo apt-get install perl-base zip unzip make python



========================================================================
Environment Setup on Windows
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Java Development Kit:
	- Obtain the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) from:
	  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
	- Run the self-installer to install JDK on your system.
	  Default options are OK.

2. Install MinGW:
	- Obtain a copy of the MinGW installer from:
	  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/
	- Run the self-installer.
	- Make sure that the MSYS option is checked.
	- Make sure that the MinGW Development Kit option is checked.
	- The default installation location is OK.
	- Complete the installation.

3. Install Python from MCP into MSYS:
	- Obtain correct vesion of MCP from the MCP wiki, at either:
	    http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases#Releases
	    http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Old_Releases#History
	- Unpack the MCP archive into a temporary folder.
	- Open the MCP folder, then navigate to the runtime -> bin
	  -> python folder.
	- Copy all of these files into the bin folder inside the
	  MSYS distribution inside MinGW (default location is
	  C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\bin).
	- Rename the python_mcp.exe file you just copied to python.exe.

4. Install Final MSYS Utilities:
	- Open the MSYS Prompt (default C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\msys.bat).
	- Install the prerequisite zip/unzip utilities with the command:

Multiplayer Server Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download Better With Renewables:
	- Official site: https://gitorious.org/bwr
	- Git clone: https://git.gitorious.org/bwr/bwr.git
	- For users not using git, downloads of latest
	  development version are at:
	    https://gitorious.org/bwr/bwr/trees/release
	
2. Download Better Than Wolves:
	- Check the Makefile to determine the version of BTW that BWR
	  depends on.
	- Obtain correct version of BTW from forums on sargunster.com
	  http://sargunster.com/btwforum/viewforum.php?f=3
	- If a newer version is available, you can try downloading it
	  and changing the expected version in the Makefile, but results
	  are not guaranteed.
	- Place the BTWMod*.zip file in the root of the project.

3. Download Minecraft Server JAR:
	- You need the appropriate version of Minecraft on which Better
	  Than Wolves depends.
	- Latest version of Minecraft Server can be obtained from:
	    https://minecraft.net/download
	  You will need the jar, not the exe, near the bottom of the
	  page.
	- Links to download older versions are on the Minecraft wiki:
	    http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history/Development_versions
	- Place minecraft_server.jar in the root of the project.

4. Download Minecraft Coder's Pack:
	- Check the Makefile to determine the version of MCP that BWR
	  depends on; this will also correspond to the Minecraft and
	  BTW versions.
	- Obtain correct vesion of MCP from the MCP wiki, at either:
	    http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases#Releases
	    http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Old_Releases#History
	- If a newer version is available, you can try downloading it
	  and changing the expected version in the Makefile, but results
	  are not guaranteed.
	- Place the mcp*.zip file in the root of the project.

5. Run make clean:
	- In a shell in the root of the BWR project, run "make clean".
	- This will clean up any intermediate/output files from any
	  previous builds.

6. Run make:
	- In a shell in the root of the BWR project, run "make".
	- Minecraft server will be patched with BTW, then decompiled,
	  the source code will be patched with BWR, then recompiled.

7. Install bwr_btw_minecraft_server.jar:
	- The bwr_btw_minecraft_server.jar file is the final output.
	- Install this wherever you want your multiplayer server to be
	  (or update and restart your existing server).
	- Note that this file contains code that is copyright by third
	  parties, and thus is NOT redistributable under the terms of
	  the BWR license.
	- The server JAR can be used on any operating system, regardless
	  of which operating system you used to build it, e.g. a JAR
	  built on Windows can be used on a Linux server.
