SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Better With Renewables is an add-on for the Better Than Wolves mod for
Minecraft that makes more resources renewable, obtainable, and/or
available to extend engame play, especially on custom "challenge" maps
that are resource-scarce.

DESIGN GOALS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Make all existing resources renewable, given a reasonable supply
  of starting resources.

- Make most resources that are likely not to be included in custom
  "challenge" maps obtainable using other resources that are likely
  to be included.

- Seamless integration with Better Than Wolves, retaining spirit and
  challenge of Better Than Wolves game design.  New alternative sources
  for resources will be less desirable than existing BTW methods
  when BTW methods are available.

- Do not break existing BTW or Vanilla builds or maps, do not modify
  world generation.

- Run entirely on SMP server, require no further changes to the
  Minecraft client with BTW mod installed.

FEATURES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Renewable Dirt:
	There is a block introduced by BTW that is dirt-like and
	nutrient-rich, but unsuitable for planting due to a low pH;
	rinse the acid out to leave dirt behind.  Added heat speeds up
	the process.

Renewable Clay:
	Sand rinsed in acid is etched into finer clay particles.
	Added heat speeds up the process.

Lilypads:
	Lilypads will spread (very limited) to adjacent spaces that
	meet their living requirements.  They can now grow and survive
	on deep enough flowing water, so they can be farmed using pumps
	with Hardcore Buckets, when water sources are scarce.

Diamond:
	Diamond equipment is obtainable by trading with villagers.
	These can be broken down into raw diamonds (for uses in lenses
	and other tools) by dissolving the agents that bond them in a
	very strong alkaline.

Lapis Lazuli:
	Lapis particles can be washed from the products of the genetic
	mutants that create it. A fine mineral powder will bond to the
	lapis and make it settle out of suspension.

Soul Sand:
	Fresh souls, harvested without human violence, can be forced
	under high pressure into sand by machinery made of sufficiently
	hard materials.  The reaction is highly exothermic.

Netherrack:
	The essence of hellfire is distilled from the nether by
	organisms that have evolved in that most hostile of
	environments.  Combined with the requisite Souls of the Damned,
	these can be infused into an appropriate medium.

Lava Source:
	A block of a certain very hot solid can be melted into lava from
	the added heat of nearby lava.

Plant Crossbreeding:
	A highly fertile space, left unplanted, will encourage the
	growth of mutations from nearby species.  This process is sped
	up by added genetic diversity.

Dead Shrubs:
	Render the leaves off a living plant of similar shape.
