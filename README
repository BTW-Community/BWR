PURPOSE

RENEWABILITY

Make all existing resources renewable, given at least a
finite starting supply of all normally-obtainable
resources.

This allows challenge maps such as skyblock/skygrid
to enjoy extended playability with minor or no changes,
by ensuring that no resource is finite, and thus the
play experience can scale out as necessary.

OBTAINABILITY

Make most resources that are less likely to be included
in custom challenge maps obtainable, given a basic set of
starting materials necessary for reasonable vanilla
gameplay.

Minimize the need for changes in custom challenge maps
to enjoy full extended gameplay.


DESIGN GOALS

Do not make any materials easier to obtain.
Challenge/expense of renewable techniques should be
higher than existing methods.

Run entirely on SMP server, require no client changes.

Follow design goals of Better Than Wolves.

Work with any existing vanilla and/or BTW map, i.e. do
not break builds.
