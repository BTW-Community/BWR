Obtainable Wolves
	Need a way to get wolves in superflat (limited biomes).
	Ideas:
	- Terraform an area with sufficient spruce trees, and
	  they'll spawn (or change the biome to forest/tundra).
	- Wolves spawn in spaces with enough sheep and low
	  enough light level.
	- Cross-breed animals.

End Portal
	Endstone as a prereq, as it can now be gathered from
	endermen, even in the overworld.

Mob Spawners
	Need to be able to make these in custom maps, minimally
	for mossy cobble gen, or BD's are out.
	Ideas:
	- Trap sufficient number of target mobs in a space, in-
	  world build.
	- Complex in-world build of expensive materials, type of
	  mob spawned is random or evolves based on nearby.
	- Make user-made spawners spawn useless mobs, e.g. ones
	  that die immediately with no drops, so they're ONLY
	  useable for cobblegen.
	- Create an alternative to spawners for mossygen...?

Dragon Egg
	This is supposed to be unique, but what if it is lost, or
	custom maps lack a dragon?
	Ideas:
	- Create replacement ender crystals; placing enough of these
	  close to each other in the end will summon the dragon.
