DEVELOPMENT TASKS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allow Animal Summoning with Light Blocks?
	- Could still be consistent with hemp.
	- Light blocks don't have to be a substitute for sunlight for
	  glowstone synth.
	- Would help out Pfilson on 404 world.

Add smallest magma cubes to animal xb, as they don't drop shit, and
	can set parents comically on fire.

Make Plant XB Less Boring
	- Creepers near plant xb increas probability of parent/child
	  species relative to clone, i.e. they accelerate mutation.
	- Creepers can sometimes be bred from plant xb.
	- Make creeper heads an xb result...?

Wither Skeletons
	Not available without a Nether Fort.
	Cross-breed them?
	Some ritual to convert a regular skeleton? e.g. throw coal
	dust at them?  Require netherbrick in ritual?
	Poison a skeleton with splash potion?

Mob Spawners
	Need to be able to make these in custom maps, minimally
	for mossy cobble gen, or BD's are out.
	Ideas:
	- Trap sufficient number of target mobs in a space, in-
	  world build.
	- Complex in-world build of expensive materials, type of
	  mob spawned is random or evolves based on nearby.
	- Make user-made spawners spawn useless mobs, e.g. ones
	  that die immediately with no drops, so they're ONLY
	  useable for cobblegen.
	- Create an alternative to spawners for mossygen...?
	  Maybe nether portals create mossy too, in some way.
	- A device made of a companion cube surrounded by SFS.
	  Apply redstone power atop each of the SFS blocks.
	  Companion soul will be sent BACK to alternate
	  dimension from which mobs come (turning it into wool),
	  and mossy cobble radiation is emitted.  Creates an
	  incentive to auto-farm companion cubes.
	  - Catch-22 BD needed to make CC to make Mossy for BD!?

Obtainable Fungus
	- Hydrated fertile soil at light level 0 grows mushrooms
	  spontaneously, very slowly...?
	- Will allow us to bootstrap netherrack without needing
	  to seed mushrooms into world.
	- Perhaps disallow netherrack XB when not in nether?

Obtainable Villagers
	- Cross-breeding?
	- Some other method?

Snow/Ice
	- Peltier effect cooler using gold block -> repeater ->
	  gold block, pass current through repeater.  Freezes
	  water near input side, evaporates water or sets fires
	  near the output side.
	- Ice is collectable using a BD.
	- Grind ice in millstone into snowballs.
	- Allows access to snow golems and snowballs on maps with
	  no tundra.

End Portal
	- Endstone as a prereq, as it can now be gathered from
	  endermen, even in the overworld.
	- Alternatively, silverfish egg blocks instead; leads to
	  interesting lore re: relationship between silverfish and
	  the end.
	- Place a beacon block in the center visible to sky.
	- Could be interesting to automate silverfish crossbreeding.

Dragon Egg
	This is supposed to be unique, but what if it is lost, or
	custom maps lack a dragon?
	Ideas:
	- Create replacement ender crystals; placing enough of these
	  close to each other in the end will summon the dragon.

Nether Quartz

DOCUMENTATION/SUPPORT TASKS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update BWR OP on Sargunster's BTW Forums with latest README data.

Test building and create instructions for OSX.

Create an extremely specific install guide for Windows users who have
limited understanding of operating systems basics that are necessary to
follow the process in INSTALL.  A guide with pictures and specific
per-click instructions would help, plus possibly a video.
