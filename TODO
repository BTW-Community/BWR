MAKE A CHANGELOG

Before full release, remove all penis-printing code.

Known/Suspected Broken Features:
	- Soul press doesnt work until the xp orb is reloaded, Dawn and zhil are working on this
		
	- Lava creation doesnt work, because i changed the 
	   to replace FCBlockOpaqueEarth to work with the new dung, 
	   but that class doesnt have hellfire blocks within it.
	   this could be fixed by just creating a new class for dung 
	   or a new class for hellfire blocks.
	   
	- Lossy Grinding (multi-ingredient recipes)

	- Crossbreeding in planters no longer works
	  Crossbreeding also needs an extensive rewrite for multiple reasons:
		1) I do not understand how it currently works
		2) certain crops such as fungi, melons, pumpkins, and saplings are not spawning
		3) Exp is MIGHTY salty about it
		
	

	
Balance Issues
	-Lossy Grinding Gold Balancing: Hiracho had a wonderful idea to use gold dust instead of nuggets

	- Animal Crossbreeding might be a little too good

Remove Diamond deconstruction
	- Diamond tools and equipment use diamond ingots now, so the deconstruction makes no sense to convert them into diamond
	  if more diamonds are needed, you can synthesise more.

Testing:
	- Create a comprehensive feature test plan.
	- Test all features.
	- Build a test world?

Make Plant XB Less Boring
	- Creepers near plant xb increas probability of parent/child
	  species relative to clone, i.e. they accelerate mutation.
	- Creepers can sometimes be bred from plant xb.
	- Make creeper heads an xb result...?
	
	- plants now grow weeds if they arent tended
	  what if to get fungi you had to let weedsd overtake a grown hemp plant
	  and it was only a chance of spawning fungi, like 10% fungi, 90% chance of tall grass

Mob Spawners
	Need to be able to make these in custom maps, minimally
	for mossy cobble gen, or BD's are out.
	Ideas:
	
	
	
		{ PRE HARDCORE EVERYTHING:
			- Probable Idea: Mob infront of block dispenser gets picked up,
				creates an "artificial" spawner (can be differentiated with NBT).
				This artificial spawner needs to be mechanically powered. 
				probably needs to be balanced still, but its a good start
	
			- Trap sufficient number of target mobs in a space, in-
				world build.
			- Complex in-world build of expensive materials, type of
				mob spawned is random or evolves based on nearby.
			- Make user-made spawners spawn useless mobs, e.g. ones
				that die immediately with no drops, so they're ONLY
				useable for cobblegen.
			- Create an alternative to spawners for mossygen...?
				Maybe nether portals create mossy too, in some way.
			- A device made of a companion cube surrounded by SFS.
				Apply redstone power atop each of the SFS blocks.
				Companion soul will be sent BACK to alternate
				dimension from which mobs come (turning it into wool),
				and mossy cobble radiation is emitted.  Creates an
				incentive to auto-farm companion cubes.
			- Catch-22 BD needed to make CC to make Mossy for BD!? 
		}

End Portal
	- Endstone as a prereq, as it can now be gathered from
	  endermen, even in the overworld.
	- Alternatively, silverfish egg blocks instead; leads to
	  interesting lore re: relationship between silverfish and
	  the end.
	- Place a beacon block in the center visible to sky.
	  - Wither too hard to fight on a skyblock?
	- Could be interesting to automate silverfish crossbreeding.

Dragon Egg
	This is supposed to be unique, but what if it is lost, or
	custom maps lack a dragon?
	Ideas:
	- Create replacement ender crystals; placing enough of these
	  close to each other in the end will summon the dragon.
