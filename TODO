DEVELOPMENT TASKS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Refine Villager Cross-Breeding requirements

Renewable Glowstone
	Ideas:
	- Concentrate sunlight using a lens, directly into a block
	  of obsidian (or emerald?).
	- Concentrated sunlight onto redstone to make glow dust;
	  when the restone receives a rising edge signal, if it's
	  exposed to sunlight through lens, it has a chance of
	  popping off as glowstone dust; need to use a clock circuit.
	  Can detect when circuit is broken, instead of using a
	  buddy block.

Renewable Diamond
	Removed from villager trades.

Refine Blaze Cross-Breeding Requirements

Wither Skeletons
	Not available without a Nether Fort.
	Cross-breed them?
	Some ritual to convert a regular skeleton? e.g. throw coal
	dust at them?  Require netherbrick in ritual?
	Poison a skeleton with splash potion?

Mob Spawners
	Need to be able to make these in custom maps, minimally
	for mossy cobble gen, or BD's are out.
	Ideas:
	- Trap sufficient number of target mobs in a space, in-
	  world build.
	- Complex in-world build of expensive materials, type of
	  mob spawned is random or evolves based on nearby.
	- Make user-made spawners spawn useless mobs, e.g. ones
	  that die immediately with no drops, so they're ONLY
	  useable for cobblegen.
	- Create an alternative to spawners for mossygen...?
	  Maybe nether portals create mossy too, in some way.

End Portal
	Endstone as a prereq, as it can now be gathered from
	endermen, even in the overworld.

Dragon Egg
	This is supposed to be unique, but what if it is lost, or
	custom maps lack a dragon?
	Ideas:
	- Create replacement ender crystals; placing enough of these
	  close to each other in the end will summon the dragon.

DOCUMENTATION/SUPPORT TASKS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update BWR OP on Sargunster's BTW Forums with latest README data.

Test building and create instructions for OSX.

Create an extremely specific install guide for Windows users who have
limited understanding of operating systems basics that are necessary to
follow the process in INSTALL.  A guide with pictures and specific
per-click instructions would help, plus possibly a video.
