End Portal
	Endstone as a prereq, as it can now be gathered from
	endermen in the overworld.

Mob Spawners
	Need to be able to make these in custom maps, minimally
	for mossy cobble gen.

Dragon Egg
	This is supposed to be unique, but what if it is lost, or
	custom maps lack a dragon?

Plant Mutating/Cross-Breeding
	A way to obtain various plant crops on challenge maps
	when exploration is not viable.
	- Plant 2 or more different types of plant in a 3x3
	- Additional plants may grow between them, depending on
	  survival requirements being met
	- Certain combinations will encourag certain mutations
