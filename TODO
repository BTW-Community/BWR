Automatic Update Check
	Spin off a background thread in mod_BWR init.
	Hit gitorious.org/bwr/bwr/blobs/raw/release/src/mod_BetterWithRenewables.java
	and download the source for latest-released mod class.
	Use regexes and search for bwrVersionString and bwrDevVersion
	literal values.
	If bwrDevVersion == false (sanity check), then store
	bwrVersionString with mod class.
	When user connects, if mod version != latest version, send
	an alert re: update available.

Refine Villager Cross-Breeding requirements

Obtainable Nether Portals
	Villager trading changes break diamond->obsidian->portal
	route on flatcore.
	Idea: make a portal out of emerald blocks instead, and
	perform a "dark ritual", e.g. right-click on an on-fire
	priest inside the portal while holding an arcane scroll,
	to taint emerald into obsidian and create portal (and
	possibly spawn some consequences).

Renewable Glowstone
	Ideas:
	- Concentrate sunlight using a lens, directly into a block
	  of obsidian (or emerald?).
	- Concentrated sunlight onto redstone to make glow dust;
	  when the restone receives a rising edge signal, if it's
	  exposed to sunlight through lens, it has a chance of
	  popping off as glowstone dust; need to use a clock circuit.
	  Can detect when circuit is broken, instead of using a
	  buddy block.

Renewable Diamond
	Removed from villager trades.

Refine Blaze Cross-Breeding Requirements

Wither Skeletons
	Not available without a Nether Fort.
	Cross-breed them?
	Some ritual to convert a regular skeleton? e.g. throw coal
	dust at them?  Require netherbrick in ritual?
	Poison a skeleton with splash potion?

Mob Spawners
	Need to be able to make these in custom maps, minimally
	for mossy cobble gen, or BD's are out.
	Ideas:
	- Trap sufficient number of target mobs in a space, in-
	  world build.
	- Complex in-world build of expensive materials, type of
	  mob spawned is random or evolves based on nearby.
	- Make user-made spawners spawn useless mobs, e.g. ones
	  that die immediately with no drops, so they're ONLY
	  useable for cobblegen.
	- Create an alternative to spawners for mossygen...?
	  Maybe nether portals create mossy too, in some way.

End Portal
	Endstone as a prereq, as it can now be gathered from
	endermen, even in the overworld.

Dragon Egg
	This is supposed to be unique, but what if it is lost, or
	custom maps lack a dragon?
	Ideas:
	- Create replacement ender crystals; placing enough of these
	  close to each other in the end will summon the dragon.
