Fix Redstone (game crashes on placement (var7 is null))
Fix Wolves (Render invisisble) // Might not be fixed. need to test breeding 
Fix Millstone Recipes
	Gold balance issues
	millstone no longer has multiple inventory slots, ergo it cannot be used for redstone synthesis

Fix BWR VersionUpdateThread

Update BWR to use Dawn Library for Entity mapping and replacing
Testing:
	- Create a comprehensive feature test plan.
	- Test all features.
	- Build a test world?

Known/Suspected Broken Features:
	- Soul Press
	- Dung Washer
	- Cauldron Recipes
	- Lossy Grinding (multi-ingredient recipes)

Make Plant XB Less Boring
	- Creepers near plant xb increas probability of parent/child
	  species relative to clone, i.e. they accelerate mutation.
	- Creepers can sometimes be bred from plant xb.
	- Make creeper heads an xb result...?

Mob Spawners
	Need to be able to make these in custom maps, minimally
	for mossy cobble gen, or BD's are out.
	Ideas:
	- Trap sufficient number of target mobs in a space, in-
	  world build.
	- Complex in-world build of expensive materials, type of
	  mob spawned is random or evolves based on nearby.
	- Make user-made spawners spawn useless mobs, e.g. ones
	  that die immediately with no drops, so they're ONLY
	  useable for cobblegen.
	- Create an alternative to spawners for mossygen...?
	  Maybe nether portals create mossy too, in some way.
	- A device made of a companion cube surrounded by SFS.
	  Apply redstone power atop each of the SFS blocks.
	  Companion soul will be sent BACK to alternate
	  dimension from which mobs come (turning it into wool),
	  and mossy cobble radiation is emitted.  Creates an
	  incentive to auto-farm companion cubes.
	  - Catch-22 BD needed to make CC to make Mossy for BD!?

End Portal
	- Endstone as a prereq, as it can now be gathered from
	  endermen, even in the overworld.
	- Alternatively, silverfish egg blocks instead; leads to
	  interesting lore re: relationship between silverfish and
	  the end.
	- Place a beacon block in the center visible to sky.
	  - Wither too hard to fight on a skyblock?
	- Could be interesting to automate silverfish crossbreeding.

Dragon Egg
	This is supposed to be unique, but what if it is lost, or
	custom maps lack a dragon?
	Ideas:
	- Create replacement ender crystals; placing enough of these
	  close to each other in the end will summon the dragon.
