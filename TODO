Known/Suspected Broken Features:
	-FC added a new dung block to replace the old, therefore anything referencing the old Dung block will be broken
		- Soul Press (Dragon Orbs dont combine, and the dung doesnt become soulsand) 
		(seems like this is caused by using the old Dung Block.	
	  
		- Clay Washing doesnt seem to work, probably for the same reason that the soul press doesnt work
		
	- Lava creation doesnt work, because i changed the 
	   to replace FCBlockOpaqueEArth to work with the new dung, 
	   but that class doesnt have hellfire blocks within it.
	   this could be fixed by just creating a new class for dung 
	   or a new class for hellfire blocks.
	   
	- Lossy Grinding (multi-ingredient recipes) (Gold DEFINITELY NEEDS BALANCING)
	- Blaze breeding is possibly glitched. only worked once
	- Crossbreeding in planters no longer works

	
Balance Issues

Testing:
	- Create a comprehensive feature test plan.
	- Test all features.
	- Build a test world?

Make Plant XB Less Boring
	- Creepers near plant xb increas probability of parent/child
	  species relative to clone, i.e. they accelerate mutation.
	- Creepers can sometimes be bred from plant xb.
	- Make creeper heads an xb result...?
	
	- plants now grow weeds if they arent tended
	  what if to get fungi you had to let weedsd overtake a grown hemp plant
	  and it was only a chance of spawning fungi, like 10% fungi, 90% chance of tall grass

Mob Spawners
	Need to be able to make these in custom maps, minimally
	for mossy cobble gen, or BD's are out.
	Ideas:
	
	- Probable Idea: Mob infront of block dispenser gets picked up,
	  creates an "artificial" spawner (can be differentiated with NBT).
	  This artificial spawner needs to be mechanically powered. 
	  probably needs to be balanced still, but its a good start
	
	- Trap sufficient number of target mobs in a space, in-
	  world build.
	- Complex in-world build of expensive materials, type of
	  mob spawned is random or evolves based on nearby.
	- Make user-made spawners spawn useless mobs, e.g. ones
	  that die immediately with no drops, so they're ONLY
	  useable for cobblegen.
	- Create an alternative to spawners for mossygen...?
	  Maybe nether portals create mossy too, in some way.
	- A device made of a companion cube surrounded by SFS.
	  Apply redstone power atop each of the SFS blocks.
	  Companion soul will be sent BACK to alternate
	  dimension from which mobs come (turning it into wool),
	  and mossy cobble radiation is emitted.  Creates an
	  incentive to auto-farm companion cubes.
	  - Catch-22 BD needed to make CC to make Mossy for BD!?

End Portal
	- Endstone as a prereq, as it can now be gathered from
	  endermen, even in the overworld.
	- Alternatively, silverfish egg blocks instead; leads to
	  interesting lore re: relationship between silverfish and
	  the end.
	- Place a beacon block in the center visible to sky.
	  - Wither too hard to fight on a skyblock?
	- Could be interesting to automate silverfish crossbreeding.

Dragon Egg
	This is supposed to be unique, but what if it is lost, or
	custom maps lack a dragon?
	Ideas:
	- Create replacement ender crystals; placing enough of these
	  close to each other in the end will summon the dragon.
