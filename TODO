Refine Villager Cross-Breeding requirements

Renewable Diamond
	Removed from villager trades.

Renewable Redstone Catch-22
	Requires a hibachi, which requires redstone.  Maybe
	grind gold and hellfire together instead of melt,
	for a low-efficiency bootstrap alternative?

Obtainable Nether Portals
	Villager trading changes break diamond->obsidian->portal
	route on flatcore.
	Idea: make a portal out of emerald blocks instead, and
	perform a "dark ritual", e.g. right-click on an on-fire
	priest inside the portal while holding an arcane scroll,
	to taint emerald into obsidian and create portal (and
	possibly spawn some consequences).

Renewable Glowstone

SoulSand Catch-22
	Soulsand currently requires sand, which requires gravel,
	which may require using mining charges on cobble.  Mining
	charges require hellfire, which requires a hopper w/
	soulsand filter.  We may need some way to bootstrap this
	process without hellfire or gravel.
	Grind/stew netherwart alone for low-efficiency hellfire
	production?

End Portal
	Endstone as a prereq, as it can now be gathered from
	endermen, even in the overworld.

Mob Spawners
	Need to be able to make these in custom maps, minimally
	for mossy cobble gen, or BD's are out.
	Ideas:
	- Trap sufficient number of target mobs in a space, in-
	  world build.
	- Complex in-world build of expensive materials, type of
	  mob spawned is random or evolves based on nearby.
	- Make user-made spawners spawn useless mobs, e.g. ones
	  that die immediately with no drops, so they're ONLY
	  useable for cobblegen.
	- Create an alternative to spawners for mossygen...?

Dragon Egg
	This is supposed to be unique, but what if it is lost, or
	custom maps lack a dragon?
	Ideas:
	- Create replacement ender crystals; placing enough of these
	  close to each other in the end will summon the dragon.

Grinding Glowstone
	Convenience recipe to grind glowstone block into 3 dust in
	a millstone (average output).  For the cost of setting up a
	millstone (tech tree advancement), you get predictability
	and convenience.  Useful when glowstone is bought primarily
	in block form in villager trading, but used mainly in dust
	form for elements.

Blazes, Wither Skeletons
	Not available without a Nether Fort.

Villagers
	Not available without exploration and villages.
